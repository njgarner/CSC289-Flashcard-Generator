## Instructions for connecting to Database
### Installing MySQL
1. Install MySQL Ver 8.x
2. Create your MySQL root password (Write this password down and **DO NOT** forget it)
4. Follow regular install procedures
5. Once installed, open Command Prompt and connect to MySQL.
   ``- mysql -u root -p``
     Will Prompt for password (Enter password)
   - If error is prompted, Make sure you are CD to the correct path (MySQL Shell\Bin). I recommend watching this video, it will make life easier [https://youtu.be/kj_oW8cx6Bs?si=ZjMtV0Dpg8X3Ii1w] 

### Connecting to GitHub in CMD
1. Create directory - ``mkdir c:\code``
2. Go to directory - ``cd c:\code``
3. Create a token(Classic) in GitHub setting-Developer Settings-Personal Access Tokens-Tokens(Classic)-Generate New Token
4. After creating a token, back to the command prompt - ``git clone https://[Token]@github.com/njgarner/CSC289-Flashcard-Generator.git`` (Insert your token address)
5. Checkout - ``git checkout main``
6. Pull - ``git pull``

### Creating and Running Database Schema
1. ``cd C:\Code\CSC289-Flashcard-Generator\sql``
2. Before creating schema, edit create_schema.sql to adjust application username and password (Line number 2) **That is the username and password you are going to put in the setting.py file for Django**
3. ``mysql -u root -p < create_schema.sql``
4. Will prompt for root password (Enter Password)

### Dropping Database (For ReRun)
1. ``cd C:\Code\CSC289-Flashcard-Generator\sql``
2. ``mysql -u root -p < drop_schema.sql``
3. Will prompt for root password (Enter Password)

## Setting up Django locally

In order to access the sqldatabase, you have to navigate to the file "settings.py" and fill in the correct info, including these 3 things:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'NAME': 'flashcard_db',
        'USER': 'your_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
    }
}

^^^ This is before we have aws configured

### Install Required Python Packages
``py -m pip install Django cryptography pymysql``

### Start the Service
``cd C:\Code\CSC289-Flashcard-Generator\mysite``

``python manage.py migrate``

``python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000``

What we have working:

We can now view these pages:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/create_deck

http://127.0.0.1:8000/login_user

http://127.0.0.1:8000/home

http://127.0.0.1:8000/library

http://127.0.0.1:8000/settings

http://127.0.0.1:8000/signup_user

Things we can do (currently without user authentication):

- Add a flashcard deck
- View what decks we have in the library, as well as the flashcards that are in the deck
- Delete a deck
- Add a flashcard to a specific deck

### AWS Environment
AWS instance is running 24/7 with static IP. On top of every hour latest changes from main get pulled and service gets restarted.
