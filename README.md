## Creating and Running Database Schema
1. cd C:\Code\CSC289-Flashcard-Generator\sql
2. Before creating schema, edit create_schema.sql to adjust application username and password (Line number 2) **That is the username and password you are going to put in the setting.py file for Django**
3. mysql -u root -p < create_schema.sql
4. Will prompt for root password (Enter Password)

### Classes Branch

In order to access the sqldatabase, you have to navigate to the file "settings.py" and fill in the correct info, including these 3 things:

DATABASES = {

        'NAME': 'flashcard_db',
        'USER': 'your_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
    }
}
